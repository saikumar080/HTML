======== Basics of HTML=========
🧑‍💻👉👉===>>>>>>✨✨✨ <html>, <head>, & <body>  ✨✨✨ <<<<<<<=========
✨. Every HTML page will (generally) have the html, head, and body tag.
✨. <html> tag encloses all the page content.
    => Hence it is also called the root element.

✨. <head> tag defines the metadata (data about data *) of the page
    => Like title (which is displayed on browser tab) using the <title> tag
    => Meta tag which can be used to defined author and keywords for the page
    => Fonts for the page
    => Styles etc.

✨. <body> tag contains the content which is displayed inside the browser window as a page.

✨.The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.

✨.The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.

✨.The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.  

✨.The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab). 

✨.The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.. 

✨.The <h1> element defines a large heading. 

✨.The <p> element defines a paragraph. 

:::::::::::::::   ✨✨✨  EMPTY ELEMENTS ✨✨✨  ::::::::::::::
 => Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). 
 => These elements are called empty elements. 
 =>Empty elements do not have an end tag!


::::::::::::  ✨✨✨ HTML Page Structure   ✨✨✨  :::::::::::::::

        Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

        <html>
        <head>
        <title>Page title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
        </body>
        </html>

        => The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. 
        =>The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
        => While using <br/> tag with help start from new line rather then using new <ptag> while allocate some new vertical space.!!!


:::::::::::::    ✨✨✨  The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration  ✨✨✨   :::::::::::::
    =>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

    =>It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

    =>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

    =>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
        🌟<!DOCTYPE html>



::::::::::   ✨✨✨    HTML Headings   ✨✨✨       ::::::::::::
    =>HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

    => <h1> defines the most important heading. 
    => <h6> defines the least important heading: 

        Example:-
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is heading 3</h3>


:::::::::  ✨✨✨  HTML Paragraphs  ✨✨✨     :::::::::::
    => HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:

    => Example:-
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>




::::::::::✨✨✨ HTML Links ✨✨✨:::::::::::
    => HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

    => Example:-
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

    => The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

    =>Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

::::::::::::  ✨✨✨ HTML Lists  ✨✨✨  :::::::::::::::::
        => Often we need to provide a list on a page - for content or links.

        => Two types of list:-
            🌟Unordered or Bulleted Lists created by <ul>.
            🌟Ordered or Numbered Lists created by <ol>.

        => Each item under the list must be enclosed in its own <li> tag to denote it as a list item.



::::::::::    ✨✨✨ HTML ATTRIBUTES  ✨✨✨    ::::::::::::::
        => All HTML elements can have attributes.

        => The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

        => The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed.

        => The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images.

        => The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image.

        => The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

        => The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page.

        => The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

       => Attributes provides additional information about elements.
       => Always specified in the start tag.
       => Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".





:::::::::       ✨✨✨ ACHOR TAG     ✨✨✨     :::::::::::::::

=> HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink.
=>You can click on it to jump to a new page or a section of the current page
=> <a> tag has one important attribute -> href
=> href -> indicates the link’s destination.
=> The content for a tag can be text or even an image.
=> The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:


    ::::: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Difference  B/w Absolute Path and Relative Path🚀🚀🚀🚀::::::::
    
    🔥🔥 Absolute Path:-
                        => An absolute URL provides the full path to the resource, starting from the root of the web. 
                        => It includes the protocol (http://, https://), domain name, and the full path to the resource.

                ✨ex:-https://www.example.com/about-us.html.
                🌟When to use:-
                :: To link to external websites.
                :: To ensure the link works regardless of the current page's location.
                :: When accessing resources hosted on a different server.

        
    🔥🔥 Relative Path:-
                    =>A relative URL specifies the path to the resource in relation to the location of the current document. 
                    =>It doesn't include the protocol or domain name, and it is often shorter.
                    
                    🌟When to use:-
                        :: To link to resources within the same website.
                        :: To simplify link management when resources on the same server.
                     ✨ex:-"../images/logo.png"


:::::::::: ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨  Links Book Marks ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨:::::::::
        => intial make id which u want to select to make book mark
